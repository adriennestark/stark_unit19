## hd-wallet-derive instructions

I had a difficult time with initially installing hd-wallet. I have included a copy of HD Wallet in this repository as I opted to copy this over from my local blockchain tools folder for ease of use. Once this was copied over, I used the instructions to set up a symlink so I could simply use  ./derive as my command.

## What this wallet does

This wallet leverages the hd-wallet derive tool to generate addresses. For the sake of this exercise we used exclusively ETH and BTCTEST. The wallet then had functions within that effectively directed the actions based upon the type of the using either bit or web3 to complete the tasks.

## Sending transactions

I struggled with sending transactions so at this moment I do not have screenshots of my transactions since I was unable to send them, but may continue to try to send them.
